# Tuberculosis Detection using Deep Learning

## 🚀 Overview
This project is a **Tuberculosis (TB) Detection** application built using **Deep Learning**. It helps in detecting TB from **Chest X-ray images**, providing a quick preliminary diagnosis. The application uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on medical imaging data.

The web-based interface allows users to:
- **Upload a Chest X-ray image**
- **Get an instant TB prediction (Positive/Negative)**
- **Learn about Tuberculosis** with useful resources and links

## 🎯 Why This Project?
- **Early detection** of TB can lead to faster treatment and better patient outcomes.
- **Assists medical professionals** by providing AI-powered predictions.
- **Can be deployed in remote areas** where radiologists may not be available.

## 🌟 Features
- **User-friendly web interface** for easy interaction.
- **Real-time TB prediction** from X-ray images.
- **Supports PNG and JPG image formats.**
- **Automatic image clearing** to ensure smooth workflow.
- **Information page** with TB awareness and WHO resources.
- **Uses CNN for accurate classification.**

## 🤖 Tech Stack
- **Python** (Core logic and model implementation)
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (Deep Learning framework)
- **Flask** (Web framework for deployment)
- **OpenCV & Pillow** (Image processing)
- **HTML, CSS,** (Web UI development)

## 📸 Demo

## 🏰 How It Works
1. **User uploads a Chest X-ray image** on the prediction page.
2. **The model processes the image** and predicts TB as **Positive or Negative**.
3. **The result is displayed** with an option to upload another image.
4. **Uploaded images are cleared automatically** to prevent clutter.
5. **Users can navigate back** to the homepage for TB-related information.

## 💪 Future Improvements
- Improve model accuracy with more advanced CNN architectures.
- Add a **probability score** for better confidence in predictions.
- Deploy the model on **cloud-based platforms** for real-world accessibility.
- Train on **larger, more diverse datasets** for improved generalization.
- Implement **multi-class classification** for detecting other lung diseases.
